## Motivation
##### Allow the users to be able to sign up and share images with one another similar to Instagram in regards to allowing them to view the images in a descending list of upload images, and then allow them to click those images of their friends and be able to comment on the images.

## Built with
* Node.js
* Express

## How to Use
##### Sign up via the landingpage or log in... then you would be directed to the main page where all the images are placed. After that it would show the users the ability to click the images so they can  read a more detailed post in regards to the image by the original poster with their description. 

## Current status
##### Not working but in the process of cleaning up and fixing the bugs to get the project up and running.
